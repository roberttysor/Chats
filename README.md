# Chats
IN PROGRESS chat client build

PURPOSE:
the purpose of this is to familiarize myself with github and with utilizing it to continuously work on a school project.
The scope of the project is to build an authentication system, which I have done.  Now I will use this chat client to
demonstrate the working functional code and aspects of design and good practices.

INPUT and FEEDBACK greatly appreciated!
